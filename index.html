<center><h1>Welcome to Hritish's E-Portfolio</h1></center>

    <p>This e-portfolio is a reflection of my learning journey, creativity, and growth across different subjects and projects. Here, you'll find a collection of my best work, from academic achievements to personal interests and skills. Each piece highlights not just what I've learned, but how I've grown as a thinker, learner, and team player.</p>
        <p>I hope you enjoy exploring my work as much as I've enjoyed creating it!</p>

<h2>About me</h2>
<img src="static/Hritish.jpeg" align="right">
<p>My name is Hritish Asapu, and I am a student of Grade 10C at JSS Private School. I come from the beautiful state of Andhra Pradesh, India.
<br>I have a strong interest in chess and coding, both of which help me develop logical thinking, creativity, and focus. Whether it's solving a tricky chess puzzle or building something new through code, I enjoy exploring challenges that make me think deeply.</p>
